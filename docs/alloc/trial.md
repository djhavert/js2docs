# Jetstream2 Trial Allocations (JTA)

Jetstream2 trial allocations provide expedited, limited access to Jetstream2 resources. With a trial allocation, approved users can “test drive” Jetstream2 prior to requesting their own ACCESS allocations. 

Trial allocations feature:

- 1000 service units (SUs) on the main Jetstream2 cloud at Indiana University (access to regional clouds is not provided)
- 1 m3.tiny (single core) or 1 m3.small (2-core) virtual machine instance
- 1 virtual machine backup snapshot per instance
- 10 GB disk external storage volume

This is meant to provide enough capacity for new users to experience “cloud native” virtual computing. It is not intended as a permanent or long-term solution.

Please note that these limits are intrinsic to the allocation and cannot be adjusted. While [virtual GPUs](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/general/vmsizes/#jetstream2-gpu) are available on Jetstream2, they are not currently part of the trial allocation program.

## Signing up for a trial allocation
To begin the process of using a Jetstream2 trial allocation:

- [Register for your ACCESS ID](https://operations.access-ci.org/identity/new-user)
- Visit the [Jetstream2 Trial Allocation Portal](https://portal.jetstream-cloud.org) and select “enroll” (it may take up to an hour for enrollment to go into effect)
- If using [Exosphere](https://jetstream2.exosphere.app/exosphere/home), the allocation is named with your ACCESS username plus “JTA User”
- If using [Horizon](https://js2.jetstream-cloud.org/), it is labeled with only your ACCESS username
