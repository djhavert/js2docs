# Jetstream2 Education Allocations

Under ACCESS, there are no longer allocations dedicated solely to research or education. Instead, there are categories of allocations based on the request size. We discuss those in the [Allocations Overview](overview.md) and ACCESS covers that on their [Prepare Requests: Overview](https://allocations.access-ci.org/prepare-requests){target=_blank} page.

Since educational usage is a prime use case for Jetstream2, we want to help instructors/educators figure out how to best size their request and make that request to ACCESS.

Researchers have opportunities to request ACCESS allocations at four levels.

|  Allocation | Credit Threshold |
|---|---|
| Explore ACCESS | 400,000  |
|  Discover ACCESS | 1,500,000  |
| Accelerate ACCESS | 3,000,000  |
| Maximize ACCESS | Not awarded in credits |

If you know how many instances, what sizes/flavors, and how long you need, you can estimate your SU needs using the usage estimation calculator here: [Usage Estimation Calculator](../alloc/estimator.md){target=_blank}.

Otherwise, we would suggest reviewing:

* [Budgeting for Common Usage Scenarios](budgeting.md)
* [Jetstream2 VM Sizes](../general/vmsizes.md)
* [ACCESS Credits and Jetstream2](../general/access.md)
* [Allocations Overview](overview.md)

The process is that you as the PI will:

> 1. [Create your user account](https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user){target=_blank}
> 2. [Request an allocation/ACCESS credits](https://allocations.access-ci.org/get-your-first-project){target=_blank}
> 3. [Then you will "spend" those credits on Jetstream2 resources](https://allocations.access-ci.org/exchange_calculator){target=_blank}
> 4. [Have any associate instructors or teaching assistants get ACCESS accounts](https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user){target=_blank}
> 5. [Add those associates to your allocation as resource managers](https://allocations.access-ci.org/){target=_blank}
> 6. [Your students will need to get ACCESS accounts](https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user){target=_blank}
> 7. [You add them to your allocation](https://allocations.access-ci.org/){target=_blank}

Resource managers, students, or other necessary users for your allocation may be added via [ACCESS User Management](https://allocations.access-ci.org/){target=_blank}

!!! Note
    **It can take up to four hours for allocations or users to become active AFTER your receive the email notification.**

* [Select an opportunity (choose the size of your allocation)](https://allocations.access-ci.org/prepare-requests){target=_blank}
* [Request an allocation/ACCESS credits](https://allocations.access-ci.org/get-your-first-project){target=_blank}
* [Receive credits](https://allocations.access-ci.org/exchange_calculator){target=_blank}
* [Exchange/spend those credits](https://allocations.access-ci.org){target=_blank}

You'll need a copy of your CV as the PI and the CVs of any co-PIs. We would recommend adding the course/workshop/tutorial syllabus in PDF format.

**Allow 1-2 business days for your application to go through the approval process.**

If you have questions about the the allocations process please open a ticket via either the [ACCESS Help Form](https://support.access-ci.org/user/login?destination=/open-a-ticket){target=_blank} or the [Jetstream Help Form](https://jetstream-cloud.org/contact/index.html){target=_blank}
