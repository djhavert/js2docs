* You will need to upload at least 1 SSH public key **BEFORE** deploying an instance in order to access the instances you create.</br></br>This assumes you already have an SSH key pair that you use. If not, you can import a key pair via this screen.

* On the left side bar, click on `Compute` â†’  `Key Pairs`
* Click `Import Key Pair`

    * **Key Pair Name**: `<username>`_key
